The SAFE zip in the data directory is a light version of an actual Sentinel-1 SAFE zip. The paths within the zip adhere to the ESA specifications. To keep the file size small, the tiff files in the ```measurement` directory have been replaced with empty files (crated with `touch`).

Extra, empty orbit files created with touch to test orbit file finding.
